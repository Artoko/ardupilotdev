= Introduction =

Here you will find a good and cheap method to conduct test yourself  the [http://code.google.com/p/arducopter/ ArduCopter] firmware in HIL (Hardware In the Loop) mode with the [http://www.x-plane.com X-Plane simulator].

== Details ==
*Hardware requirement:*
 * a PC computer,
 * an !ArduMega board APMv1 (1280, 2560)or APMv2,for the APMv1, no IMU shield is required (more info [http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot-mega/ HERE]),
 * the [http://www.x-plane.com/downloads/older/ X-Plane v9.70] simulator (Demo or Retail version),
 * the firmware [http://ardupilotdev.googlecode.com/files/ArduCopter_2_1_1r6.zip ArduCopter v2.1.1 R6] or more installed on the APM,
 * the [http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot-mega/downloads/list Mission Planner v1.1.18] (or more) installed on the PC,
 * the [http://ardupilotdev.googlecode.com/files/starter_pack.zip Starter Pack] for the HIL simulation

== Installation ==

The X-Plane v9.70 and Mission Planner must be installed on the PC and and the ArduCopter firmware installed in the APM board.

You need to add some additional files to run the full ArduCopter simulation in HIL mode, you will find [http://ardupilotdev.googlecode.com/files/starter_pack.zip the started package HERE]

 * copy the folder QRO_X into the folder *X-Plane 9 Demo/Aicraft/Radio Control/*  this is the quadcopter model for X-Plane
 * copy the file LOWI_AIRPORT.sit in the folder *X-Plane 9 Demo/Output/situations/* this is the situation for the simulation
 * upload the param file *AC211r6_Xplane.param* with the APM Planner to the APM board
 * upload the mission file *LOWI_AIRPORT_MISSION.txt* with the APM Planner to the APM board
