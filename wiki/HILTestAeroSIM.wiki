= Introduction =

Here you will find a good and cheap method to test yourself  the [http://code.google.com/p/arducopter/ ArduCopter] firmware in HIL (Hardware In the Loop) mode with the [http://www.aerosimrc.com/j/index.php/en AeroSIM-RC simulator].

== Details ==
*Hardware requirement:*
 * a PC computer,
 * an !ArduMega board APMv1 (1280, 2560)or APMv2,for the APMv1, no IMU shield is required (more info [http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot-mega/ HERE]),
 * the [http://www.aerosimrc.com/j/index.php/en/downloads AeroSIM-RC v3.81] simulator (Demo or Retail version),
 * the firmware [http://ardupilotdev.googlecode.com/files/ArduCopter22b2xp.zip ArduCopter v2.2 b2xp] or more installed on the APM,
 * the [http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot-mega/downloads/list Mission Planner v1.1.20] (or more) installed on the PC, you may download the latest version in the [http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot-mega/source/browse/ Ardupilot-mega official repository] with GIT
 * the [http://ardupilotdev.googlecode.com/files/ArduCopter_HIL_setups.zip HIL setups and param files] for the HIL simulation

== Installation ==

1) Unzip the archive AeroSimRCAPMHil.zip
2) copy the folder \APMHill in the AeroSiM folder c:\Program Files (x86)\Plugin\
3) check that in the firmware the parameters of the APM_Config.h are set:
	#define HIL_MODE 	HIL_MODE_ATTITUDE
	#define X_PLANE 	ENABLED

== Testing ==

If all is ok, you will see the quadcopter flying in a full autonomous flight...
